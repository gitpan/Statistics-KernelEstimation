Statistics-KernelEstimation version 0.02
========================================

This modules calculates Kernel Density Estimates and related quantities
for a collection of random points.

A Kernel Density Estimate (KDE) is similar to a histogram, but improves
on two known problems of histograms: it is smooth (whereas a histogram
is ragged) and does not suffer from ambiguity in regards to the placement
of bins.

In a KDE, a smooth, strongly peaked function is placed at the location
of each point in the collection, and the contributions from all points
is summed. The resulting function is a smooth approximation to the
probability density from which the set of points was drawn. The smoothness
of the resulting curve can be controlled through a bandwidth parameter.

This module calculates KDEs as well as Cumulative Density Functions (CDF).
Three different kernels are available (Gaussian, Box, Epanechnikov). The
module also offers limited support for bandwidth optimization.

Finally, the module can generate "classical" histograms and distribution
functions.
